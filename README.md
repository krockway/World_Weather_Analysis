# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this exercise is to gather and analyze weather data across the world.

I started by generating random latitudes and longitudes to collect weather data for 2000 cities. 

This information was then used to find desirable cities within a certain (user input) temperature range. The cities that fit the user criteria was displayed on a map, along with hotels nearby. 

Finally, this information was narrowed to 4 cities and an itinerary map with driving directions were produced.

To create these DataFrames and map images, I tapped into Weather and Google Maps APIs.
